You have the choice to make a global indicator visible or not on the front-end interface. In order to make the choice, you have to understand that an indicator is shown as a cell in one of the lists. The first list on the top contains the visible indicators, the second list on the bottom contains the invisible indicators. You have simply to drag&drop the indicator from one list to the other. The order of the indicators in the first list will be the order of the indicators shown on the front-page, as illustrated by the figure below:
