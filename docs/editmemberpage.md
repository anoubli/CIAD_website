# Edit the member page

> **_4 steps_**

## Step 1. Open the member page

Each active member of the research organization should have a member page on the website of the organization (if not, please contact the organization's mamanger).

For opening your member page, you have to:

1. Click on the `Team` (or `Equipe`) link in the top menu bar of the laboratory

2. Click on your name in the list
3. You member page should look like:

![Member page](editmemberpage2.png)

The member page contains components that are automatically built by the server from the information system: the top description of your profile, the list of publications, the list of supervisions, etc.

Soe other part are not automatically generated and must be edited by you maunally. Since the front-end website is based on the famous WordPress (WP) content management system (CMS), you will have to use the tools of this CMS.

## Step 2. Open the WP CMS page editor

The WordPress page editor is accessible only if you are [connected](login.md). The editor link should appear inside the top-most tool bar on the page, e.g. `Edit Page` or `Enable Visual Builder`.

After clicking on the `Edit Page` link, you should see the WP CMS page editor:

The main page of the page shows to you:

* the title of the page (usually, the value is your full name).
* an editing component for changing the content of the page.

> **_Note:_** The content of the page is based on a text in which you could write specific WP instructions. These instructions are specified between bracket characters, e.g. `[myPages]`.

The research organization server provides specific instructions for including the components that are generated by the organization's server. They are described in the following steps.

## Step 3. Adding instructions that are specific to the research organization server

### a) Instructions for creating tabs

Tab components were selected as the default way for structuring the page's content in different sections that are easy to find and display:

![Tabs](editmemberpage5.png)

For creating the tabs, you have to use two specific instructions:

* `[myPages] ... [/myPages]`: specify where you would like to include the tabs in the page. The text between the opening and closing instructions is built with a sequence of instructions, below.
* `[myPage title="The Title"] ... [/myPage]` enables you to create a tab with a specific title (e.g., `The Title`).The text between the opening and closing instructions is the content of the tab.

For example, for obtaining the tabs in the figure above, the following text is typed:

	[myPages]
		[myPage title="Publications"] ... [/myPage]
		[myPage title="Bio"] ... [/myPage]
		[myPage title="Projects"] ... [/myPage]
		[myPage title="Supervisions"] ... [/myPage]
		[myPage title="Jurys"] ... [/myPage]
		[myPage title="Invitations"] ... [/myPage]

> **_Note:_** The names of the instructions is case-sensitive.
